# WindowWatcher

A tool for me to run a shell script between switching windows/apps on a Mac. I couldn't find a way other than writing an app that monitors these changes. If you need something similar, feel free to fork and change `Application.swift` the way you need. When I have the time I might make this app more usable for other purposes.

Forked from [kyo ago's project](https://github.com/kyo-ago/Automatically-Move-Mouse-Pointer-To-Default-Button-in-a-dialog-box-for-mac/tree/5d9f60919b94eaa326370a6729b2106f9e94f6c8/Automatically%20Move%20Mouse%20Pointer%20To%20Default%20Button%20in%20a%20dialog%20box%20for%20mac).
